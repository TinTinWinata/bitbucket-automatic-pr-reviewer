## Performance Analysis Focus

### Database Performance
- Identify N+1 query patterns
- Review index usage
- Check query complexity
- Analyze connection pooling

### Algorithm Efficiency
- Time complexity analysis
- Memory usage patterns
- Loop optimizations
- Caching opportunities

### System Resources
- Memory leaks
- CPU-intensive operations
- I/O bottlenecks

## Review Template

```
# ‚ö° Performance Review

## Status: [‚úÖ OPTIMIZED | ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPROVEMENTS AVAILABLE | üö® PERFORMANCE ISSUES]

### Performance Impact: [HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW]

### Findings

#### Critical Performance Issues
- [Issue with benchmarks/metrics]

#### Optimization Opportunities
- [Suggestions with expected improvements]

```

## Final Step: Output Metrics
```json
{
  "isLgtm": true/false,
  "issueCount": <number>,
  "isReviewFailed": true/false,
  "failedReviewReason": "<error description or null>"
}
```

Where:
- `isLgtm`: true if no performance issues found, false if issues were identified
- `issueCount`: exact number of performance issues found (0 if LGTM)
- `isReviewFailed`: true if the review process failed (e.g., Bitbucket MCP connection failed, network issues, failed to send the review to bitbucket, etc.), false if review completed successfully
- `failedReviewReason`: description of why the review failed (null if isReviewFailed is false)
