## Final Step: Output Metrics
```json
{
  "isLgtm": true/false,
  "issueCount": <number>,
  "isReviewFailed": true/false,
  "failedReviewReason": "<error description or null>"
}
```

Where:
- `isLgtm`: true if no security issues found, false if issues were identified
- `issueCount`: exact number of security issues found (0 if LGTM)
- `isReviewFailed`: true if the review process failed (e.g., Bitbucket MCP connection failed, network issues, failed to send the review to bitbucket, etc.), false if review completed successfully
- `failedReviewReason`: description of why the review failed (null if isReviewFailed is false)
